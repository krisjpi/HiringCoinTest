# HiringCoinTest
Just an idea I've been playing with for a while, creating the repository to start work on token design.

This is just a simple description of the project... The idea is to create a limited number of tokens that can 
be used to both demonstrate an ability to deploy a basic erc20 token to the ethereum mainnet, and to use as a
novel way of reaching out to potential employers in the blockchain space for hiring, and/or managing the 
amount of freelance work I (or anyone) is able to do.

The number of coins should be very small (like maybe 100 - 10000 total?) with as few decimals as possible. This is not meant to be a distributed coin, and the transaction volume is intentionally small.

This will be my first time developing a token and deploying to the mainnet (when/if I do). I am also using the
token tutorial from Blockchain Developers United (BDU) as a template, which can be found here:
