# HiringCoinTest
Just an idea I've been playing with for a while, creating the repository to start work on token design.

This is just a simple description of the project... The idea is to create a limited number of tokens that can be used to both demonstrate
an ability to deploy a basic erc20 token to the ethereum mainnet, and to use as a novel way of reaching out to potential employers in the
blockchain space for hiring, and/or managing the amount of freelance work I do.

This will be my first time developing a token and deploying to the mainnet (when I do). I am also using the token tutorial from Blockchain
Developers United (BDU) as a template, which can be found here: https://github.com/BlockchainDevelopersUnited/TokenTutorial. 

I am very loosely affiliated with BDU having been involved with both Queens Blockchain Innovation Community and Kingston Blockchainers, and 
led/particpated in the token tutorial with a few others on Queen's campus a little while back.
