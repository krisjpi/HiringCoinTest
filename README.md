# HiringCoinTest
Just an idea I've been playing with for a while, creating the repository to start work on token design.

This is just a simple description of the project... The idea is to create a limited number of tokens that can 
be used to both demonstrate an ability to deploy a basic erc20 token to the ethereum mainnet, and to use as a
novel way of reaching out to potential employers in the blockchain space for hiring, and/or managing the 
amount of freelance work I (or anyone) is able to do.

The number of coins should be very small (like maybe 100 - 10000 total?) with as few decimals as possible. This
is not meant to be a distributed coin, and the transaction volume is intentionally small.

The concept includes more than just the issuance of the coin, as it is intended to have an initial payout to a 
single address - my own, the issuer. The intention would be to create another wallet with enough ETH to handle 
a few transactions at a time, and connect it to a live website faucet (very similar to getting test ETH at
https://faucet.metamask.io). The faucet could be kept stocked with only as much time as I have to devote to 
projects at any given time. Prospective employers could navigate here, claim a token using metamask, and 
transfer it to my public work address. This could be a symbolic gesture of an intention of offer, or could 
include details of the work or contract in the transaction notes (pretty sure this is possible? test). The 
transfer of tokens from my public wallet to the faucet address could also use this function (if possible) to 
publish details on the work/completion/contract/any other relevant detail. This could potentially become a 
portfolio of work as well. 

This will be my first time developing a token and deploying to the mainnet (when/if I do). I am also using the
token tutorial from Blockchain Developers United (BDU) as a template, which can be found here:
